I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Sungkyunkwan University, where I work with Prof. [Hojoon Lee](https://hojoon-lee.github.io) at the [System Security Lab](https://sslab.skku.edu).

My research sits at the intersection of **(operating) system design** and **(software) security**, currently focusing on software compartmentalization and developing practical defenses against side-channel attacks, and automated program analysis.
I'm particularly interested in how thoughtful architectural design can make systems inherently more secure.

My work includes novel hardware-assisted **compartmentalization models** (receiving the [ACM CCS Distinguished Paper Award in 2023](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS_awards/ccs-bestpaper.html)), and new **obfuscation techniques** that enhance security while maintaining performance in confidential virtual machines (accepted for publication in [IEEE S&P 2025](https://sp2025.ieee-security.org/)).

**I am expected to graduate in 2025 and looking for new adventures and collaborations. Please get in touch with me to discuss opportunities.**
