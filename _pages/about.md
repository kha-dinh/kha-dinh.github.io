I am Kha Dinh (_ƒêinh Duy Kha_), a fifth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Hojoon Lee](https://hojoon-lee.github.io) at [System Security Lab](https://sslab.skku.edu), [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu).
My research focuses on the intersection of systems design and security, with specific interests in memory safety, program compartmentalization, operating systems design, trusted execution environments, and side-channel mitigation techniques. I am the recipient of the [ACM CCS Distinguished Paper Award](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS_awards/ccs-bestpaper.html) in 2023.
