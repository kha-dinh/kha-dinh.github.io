The software stack for developing and launching Intel SGX enclaves is such a mess.
Parts of this is due to confusing naming, and lack of centralized documentations.
This post the process of me trying make sense of it from a developer point of view.

## The software stack

There are awfully lots of moving parts involved in launching an SGX enclave.

- The **SGX Driver** allows interaction with SGX hardware components. The driver
  uses privileged instruction for enclave management (e.g., `ECREATE`, `EADD`,
  `EEXTEND`). Three endpoints are exposed to the userspace, which are
  communicated with through IOCTL APIs.
  - `/dev/sgx_enclave` provides APIs for enclave management ([2]). Some of the APIs:
    - `SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_CREATE` allocates kernel structures and invokes `ECREATE`
      to create an enclave.
    - `SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_ADD_PAGES` add pages to uninitialized enclaves and also
      optionally extends its measurement.
    - `SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_INIT` finalize enclave initialization.
  - `/dev/sgx_provision`: Not sure what it does currently, probably related to secret provisioning.
  - `/dev/sgx_vepc` (the virtual EPC) support launching SGX enclave in guest
    virtual machines.
- **Intel PSW (Platform SoftWare)** is the userspace component in charge of
  launching enclaves and provide runtime services (key provisioning, remote
  attestation).
  - **AESM (Architectural Enclave Service Manager)** service is maintained as a
    single binary installed at `opt/intel/sgxpsw/aesm/aesm_service` that is
    launched by `systemd` ([1]).
  - AESM perform the task of launching **architectural enclaves** ([3]) that
    serve runtime services.
- **Intel SGX SDK** Contains libraries and tools that is used to develop SGX
  applications.
  - The library is divided into 3 functional components ([1]):
    - **Trusted RunTime System (TRTS)** is linked with the user enclave code
    - **Untrusted RunTime System (URTS)** is linked with the untrusted part of
      the application that set up the enclave application by communicating with
      the `aesm_service` through sockets and pipes.
    - The **Enclave standard library** provides minimal standard C/C++
      functionalities (except for I/O related tasks)
  - THe SDK also provides utility for building and distributing enclaves:
    - `Edger8r` converts EDL files into actual interface implementation.
    - `sgx_sign` signs enclave binaries
    - `sgx-gdb` allows debugging of enclaves
- **sgx-ssl** is a port of OpenSSL to be executed inside SGX enclaves,
  which provide cryptographic primitives to enclaves, e.g., for key signing.
- **DCAP (Data Center Attestation Primitives)** provides two main libraries
  which are important in remote attestation.
  - **Quote generation** allows an enclave to generate a _quote_, which includes
    the measurement (hash) of its initial state.
  - **Quote verification** enable a remove verifier to verify a generated
    _quote_.

## Interactions

Below are my attempts at providing an overview of how the software components
interact with each other. Generally, the development stages of an enclave
application can be classified into _build time_ and _deployment time_.

The diagrams contain all the components (and subcomponents) that were mentioned
above. Note that this is heavily simplified, and may be also incorrect, as
it reflect my current understanding.

### Build time

The goal of building phase is to compile the source files of the enclave and the
untrusted application, and an specification for the interface between them
written in Enclave Definition Language (EDL). The output are (1) a signed
enclave ELF and (2) the untrusted application, which is a normal ELF file.

### Deployment time

To deploy an enclave, the untrusted part of the enclave application communicate
with `aesm_service` to create and initialize the enclave.

## Distribution

Intel provides a prebuilt version for most components, so the users don't have
to rebuild them from scratch. They can be accessed at
<https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/linux-latest/>

The driver for SGX is built into most modern Linux distribution (since Linux
5.11 [3]), so manually installing them is not encouraged.
