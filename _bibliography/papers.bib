  abstract = { Recent works have repeatedly proven the practicality of
              side-channel attacks in undermining the confidentiality guarantees
              of Trusted Execution Environments such as Intel SGX. Meanwhile, the
              trusted execution in the cloud is witnessing a trend shift towards
              confidential virtual machines (CVMs). Unfortunately, several
              side-channel attacks have survived the shift and are feasible even
              for CVMs, along with the new attacks discovered on the CVM
              architectures. Previous works have explored defensive measures for
              securing userspace enclaves (i.e., Intel SGX) against side-channel
              attacks. However, the design space for a CVM-based obfuscation
              execution engine is largely unexplored. This paper proposes a
              unikernel design named NCOGNITOS provide full-system obfuscation
              for CVM-based cloud workloads. INCOGNITOS fully embraces unikernel
              principles such as minimized TCB and direct hardware access to
              render full-system obfuscation feasible. INCOGNITOS retrofits two
              key OS components, the scheduler and memory management, to
              implement a novel adaptive obfuscation scheme. INCOGNITOS's
              scheduling is designed to be self-sovereign from the timer
              interrupts from the untrusted hypervisor with its synchronous tick
              delivery. This allows INCOGNITOS to reliably monitor the frequency
              of the hypervisor's possession of execution control (i.e., VMExits)
              and adjust the frequency of memory rerandomization performed by the
              paging subsystem, which transparently performs memory
              rerandomization through direct MMU access. The resulting INCOGNITOS
              design makes a case for a self-obfuscating unikernel as a secure
              CVM deployment strategy while further advancing the obfuscation
              technique compared to previous works. Evaluation results
              demonstrate INCOGNITOS'S resilience against CVM attacks and show
              that its adaptive obfuscation scheme enables practical performance
              for real-world programs. },

  abstract = {Rust is gaining traction as a safe systems programming language
              with its strong type and memory safety guarantees. However, Rust's
              guarantees are not infallible. The use of unsafe Rust, a subvariant
              of Rust, allows the programmer to temporarily escape the strict
              Rust language semantics to trade security for flexibility. Memory
              errors within unsafe blocks in Rust have far-reaching ramifications
              for the program's safety. As a result, the conventional dynamic
              memory error detection (e.g., fuzzing) has been adapted as a common
              practice for Rust and proved its effectiveness through a trophy
              case of discovered CVEs. <br>RUSTSAN is a retrofitted design of
              AddressSanitizer (ASan) for efficient dynamic memory error
              detection of Rust programs. Our observation is that a significant
              portion of instrumented memory access sites in a Rust program
              compiled with ASan is redundant, as the Rust security guarantees
              can still be valid at the site. RUSTSAN identifies and instruments
              the sites that definitely or may undermine Rust security guarantees
              while lifting instrumentation on safe sites. To this end, RUSTSAN
              employs a cross-IR program analysis for accurate tracking of unsafe
              sites and also extends ASan's shadow memory scheme for checking
              non-uniform memory access validation necessary for Rust. We conduct
              a comprehensive evaluation of RUSTSAN in terms of detection
              capability and performance using 57 Rust crates. RUSTSAN
              successfully detected all 31 tested cases of CVE-issued memory
              errors. Also, RUSTSAN shows an average of 62.3% performance
              increase against ASan in general benchmarks that involved 20 Rust
              crates. In the fuzzing experiment with 6 crates, RUSTSAN marked an
              average of 23.52%, and up to 57.08% of performance improvement.},

  abstract = {In-process compartmentalization and access control have been
              actively explored to provide in-place and efficient isolation of
              in-process security domains. Many works have proposed
              compartmentalization schemes that leverage hardware features, most
              notably using the new page-based memory isolation feature called
              Protection Keys for Userspace (PKU) on x86. Unfortunately, the
              modern ARM architecture does not have an equivalent feature.
              Instead, newer ARM architectures introduced Pointer Authentication
              (PA) and Memory Tagging Extension (MTE), adapting the reference
              validation model for memory safety and runtime exploit mitigation.
              We argue that those features have been underexplored in the context
              of compartmentalization and that they can be retrofitted to
              implement a capability-based in-process access control scheme. <br>
              This paper presents Capacity, a novel hardware-assisted
              intra-process access control design that embraces capability-based
              security principles. Capacity coherently incorporates the new
              hardware security features on ARM that already exhibit inherent
              characteristics of capability. It supports the life-cycle
              protection of the domain's sensitive objects - starting from their
              import from the file system to their place in memory. With
              intra-process domains authenticated with unique PA keys, Capacity
              transforms file descriptors and memory pointers into
              cryptographically-authenticated references and completely mediates
              reference usage with its program instrumentation framework and an
              efficient system call monitor. We evaluate our Capacity-enabled
              NGINX web server prototype and other common applications in which
              sensitive resources are isolated into different domains. Our
              evaluation shows that Capacity incurs a low-performance overhead of
              approximately 17\% for the single-threaded and 13.54\% for the
              multi-threaded webserver.},
