I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Hojoon Lee](https://hojoon-lee.github.io) at [System Security Lab](https://sslab.skku.edu), [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu).
My research focuses on the intersection of systems design and security, with specific interests in memory safety, program compartmentalization, operating systems design, trusted execution environments, and side-channel mitigations.
